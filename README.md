# Pubquiz

The motivation of the project is to bring people back together in a fun and engaging online-activity, 
no matter if you are in quarantine or meeting each other in person.
The web application should allow for the popular Pub Quizzes to happen regardless of the current pandemic. 
Participants will be able to face off against other participants by themselves or in groups.
